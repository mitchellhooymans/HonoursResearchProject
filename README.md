# HonoursResearchProject
This is the GitHub repository for my Honours degree capstone project in astrophysics, specializing in cosmology. In this project, I aim to investigate how Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) impact the colour spaces of galaxies. In particular, I aim to quantify how AGN contaminate a galaxy's colour space across different redshifts.
