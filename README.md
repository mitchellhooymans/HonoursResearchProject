# HonoursResearchProject
This is the GitHub repository for my SEF Honours degree capstone project in astrophysics, specializing in cosmology. In this project I aim investigate how Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) impact the colour spaces of galaxies. In particular I aim to quantify how AGN contaminate a galaxies colour space across different redshifts.
