    "# Investigation of Brown's Rest-frame Templates\n",
    "this code is intended to be used to explore brown's rest-frame templates. These templates are intended to be used only to experiment with the process of combining seds and are not intended to be used to represent the final sed data as we need to potentially construct the correct galaxy seds by using correct SFHs,etc. In addition to the templates used correspond to the right galaxy type. This can be found in Brown's 2014 paper. \n",
